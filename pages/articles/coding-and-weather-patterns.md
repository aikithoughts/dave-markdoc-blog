When I was in college, I knew that mathematics--most sciences, really--were not for me. To be honest, I had high hopes and aspirations of becoming a poet.
I envisioned myself sitting at some corner coffee shop, crafting sonnets and free verse poems that captured the daily life around me. Of course, college
had its requirements, so while I *personally* didn't want to take any science classes, I still had to take *something*. One of the science classes I chose
was Atmospheric Sciences 101.

Atmospheric Sciences 101 was actually a really interesting class. I learned a lot about how weather patterns worked. But what really stood out to me was how
challenging it could be to predict weather patterns. I clearly remember our professor bringing out a double pendulum. He showed us how, once the pendulum
began to swing, it was increasingly diffcult to determine where the end of the second pendulum would end up. This situation was similar to predicting weather
patterns. You could have a rough idea about what tomorrow's weather might be, but it was very difficult to predict it exaclty.

This difficulty to predict also shows up in technical documentation. We know where new users will start for any given product or feature. In fact, we often get
to define that experience. But, after the initial quick start, what happens next becomes difficult to predict. Look at any technical documentation and you'll
find that, after completing the getting started experience, the user is quickly left adrift in a sea of options. Why is this case? Well, because we simply
don't know for sure what the user might want to do. 

Let's jump back to the weather. As you likely know, just because the weather is difficult to predict, doesn't mean that meteorologists and climatologists
don't try. So they show the next 5 or 10 days worth of weather, knowing that the accuracy of those predictions might decrease the further into the future you
get. And what about situations where you simply don't know what the weather is going to be? Say you're going to another country, and the weather patterns
are unknown. (Or, maybe, you're just visiting Seattle in November.) Guides abound on what to pack to help ensure you're at least somewhat preprared for
whatever might come your way.

I think we need to do the same thing with regards to documentation. Yes, after the quickstart, the possibilities could become innumerable. But we can still
try to make reasonable predictions. Are you building an app using React? You probably should learn about NextJS and a style library like TailwindCSS or bootstrap.
Are you building an EC2 instance on Amazon? You might want to look into database storage service like RDS. Want to add Stripe's Checkout to your application?
You might want to look into adding subscriptions, shipping, and other features.

It's all too easy to shrug your shoulders and say: "I don't know what's next. It's up to the user." But it's far *better* to think about where the user might
want to go, or should consider going, and offer what guidance we can.

Just a few thoughts.
